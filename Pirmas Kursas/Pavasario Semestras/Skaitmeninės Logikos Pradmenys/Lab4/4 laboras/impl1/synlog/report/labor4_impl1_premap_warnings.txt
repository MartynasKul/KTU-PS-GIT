@W: MT462 :"e:\ktu pirmi metai\pavasario semestras\skaitmenine logika\lab4\4 laboras\cntr49.vhd":20:2:20:3|Net CNT_2.CNT_C (pin CNT_2.CNT_C.Q[0]) appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. If this is a required clock, declare a clock constraint on this net in your constraint file.
@W: MT531 :"e:\ktu pirmi metai\pavasario semestras\skaitmenine logika\lab4\4 laboras\cntr136.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including CNT_3.CNT_A[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\ktu pirmi metai\pavasario semestras\skaitmenine logika\lab4\4 laboras\cntr19.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock TOP_CNT|CLK_I which controls 8 sequential elements including CNT_1.CNT_A[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
