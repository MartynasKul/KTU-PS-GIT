@W: MT529 :"c:\users\markul4\desktop\lab4 plis\impl1\source\cntr19 fpga.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock CNT19|CLK which controls 6 sequential elements including CNT_A[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
